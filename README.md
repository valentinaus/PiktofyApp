# Piktofy

Piktofy is a demo project made for the "Multimedia Data Bases" course. It's a social media app developed in Java (Version 1.8.0) using SQL Databases, MySQL 5.7.29, Workbench 8.0 and Netbeans IDE 8.2 and the Model-View-Controller architecture. 

It allows the users to register, post, delete, like, dislike and comment pictures. They can also find posts by their name o tag.
